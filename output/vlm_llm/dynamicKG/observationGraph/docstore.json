Next to the refrigerator, there is a sink with dishes drying on it. Moving to the center of the image, we see an oven located directly below the sink. To the right of this setup, there are some drawers with handles, suggesting a kitchen area.\n\nIn front of these cabinets, we find a dining table with a chair pushed under it. The dining table is positioned in the middle of the image, providing a focal point for the room. To the left side of the image, a couch is visible, with a clock hanging above it.\n\nOn the far right side, there is an area that appears to be a study or workspace, indicated by the presence of a desk with a computer monitor on top. Next to the desk, there is a bookcase with shelves holding books and other items.\n\nAt the front of the room, there's a kitchen counter with a coffee maker and a blender on it. Adjacent to the kitchen counter, there's an area set up for meal preparation or perhaps as a bar, featuring a mini-fridge and a wine rack with bottles.\n\nThe floor is covered in tiles, providing a clean surface throughout the room. The walls are painted white, and there are some objects like a bowl on a tabletop and a remote control on one of the couches, adding to the lived-in atmosphere of the space.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 1429, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"e20df5a9-e103-41ee-a105-bb53f8fe7bef": {"node_ids": ["d2891d41-3149-454b-9f63-9c5cb766d26b"], "metadata": {}}}}
