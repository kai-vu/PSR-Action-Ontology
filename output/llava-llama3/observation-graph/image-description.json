To the right of the countertop, a white oven stands next to a sink that has a drainboard above it. Adjacent to the sink, a cabinet with a window is visible; inside this cabinet, several items are arranged neatly on the shelf. Next to the cabinet, there's an open refrigerator. \n\nIn the dining room area, there is a table set for two, with chairs placed around it. On top of the table, various items like a bowl and some food packaging can be seen. The table is in front of a doorway that seems to lead outside or to another room. ",
