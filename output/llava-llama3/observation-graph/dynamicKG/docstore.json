Here is a description of the environment as seen from all images combined:\n\n- Kitchen Cabinets - There are black cabinets along both walls of the kitchen, with one large cabinet on each side, providing ample storage space.\n- Countertops - The countertops appear to be made of dark wood or a wood grain laminate, and there is no visible clutter or items on them.\n- Appliances - The kitchen has a refrigerator positioned to the right of the image, with its door closed. A sink with chrome fixtures is installed in the center countertop area. Above the countertop, there are two lights; one on the left and one above the sink.\n- Table - In the middle of the kitchen is a white dining table surrounded by four chairs. On top of the table, there is a small model of a house with a tree and some greenery. There is also a single cupcake holder placed on the tabletop.\n- Wall Decor - A framed picture hangs on the wall to the left of the sink, just above the countertop level. To the right of the sink, there's a white stove top oven with two burners visible.\n- Shelves and Storage - There is an open shelf unit in the far corner of the kitchen, but no items are placed on it. Additionally, a small set of cabinets is present on the far left wall of the kitchen.\n- The Floor - The kitchen has light-colored tiles covering the floor.\n- Lighting - The image shows that there's a recessed ceiling light illuminating the kitchen space from above the table and sink area.\n- Personal Touches - There are a few personal items on the countertops, such as a box of cereal, two cups (one on each side of the sink), and two bottles; one near the stove and another next to the fridge. On the table, there is also an empty glass jar with a label and a white mug.\n- The Room - Adjacent to the kitchen is a room with a door leading into it, which is visible from the kitchen perspective but not detailed in this description. The room appears to be a living space or another room of the household based on its size and position relative to the kitchen.\n\nThis description provides a comprehensive view of the environment as seen from the composite screenshot, including spatial relationships between objects.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2270, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"56feadfd-a776-426c-988e-22ae64376e57": {"node_ids": ["01d92d47-2bcd-47f7-80c7-3f9b34813281"], "metadata": {}}}}
