On the counter to the left of the refrigerator are two jars of jam or preserves, a box of Jell-O, a box of Alpen Salt, and stacks of paper plates. A pot on an electric burner sits to the right and slightly behind the refrigerator. A dining table with four white chairs stands perpendicular to the refrigerator in the adjacent room. A large bottle of Evian water sits on the table next to a toaster, some fruit, and a puzzle book. A board game and two more jugs or bottles stand on the table. A door to another room or a closet is between the table and the refrigerator. The kitchen counters have a beige surface. The kitchen cabinets are dark gray. There are two additional puzzle books on the kitchen counter and a yellow mug. The room has dark wood parquet floors. The kitchen cabinets have a built in range hood. There are cupboards above the lower counters. A wall frame hangs on the wall. A light hangs from the ceiling above the dining table. A pan sits on the stove. A clock sits on the table.",
