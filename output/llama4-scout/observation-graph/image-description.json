On the countertop, there are various items: a box of Rice Bubbles cereal, a box of strawberry banana Jello, a jar of jam, a box of shortbread cookies, a yellow mug, and a pot on a stovetop. Above the counter, there are more cabinets and a vent hood. \n\nIn the dining room, there is a wooden table with white chairs around it. On the table, there are more items: a bottle of water, a plate with fruit, a cookbook, and a mug. The floor is made of dark wood parquet tiles. \n\nThe items are scattered across both rooms. The Jello, jam, Alpen Salt, and shortbread cookies are on the kitchen counter. The Rice Bubbles cereal and yellow mug are near the stove. The bottle of water and plate of fruit are on the dining table. The cookbook and Chucky puzzle are on the kitchen counter and dining table in different images. \n\nThe layout suggests that these rooms are connected, with the kitchen opening into the dining area.",
