It features a black cabinetry system that matches the dark color scheme of the space. A stainless steel refrigerator stands to the right side of the image, with its door adorned with children's magnets. In front of the fridge, on the countertop, there are two items: a white coffee cup and a box labeled \"SUN-MAID.\"\n\nTo the left of the fridge is a wooden dining table set against a clean, white wall. The table has a single place setting with a knife resting on it. A small amount of trash can be seen next to the table, suggesting recent meal preparation or consumption.\n\nThe kitchen is illuminated by recessed lighting in the ceiling, casting a warm glow throughout the space. On the far left side of the image, there's an open door that leads to another room not fully visible within this image. There are two items on the countertop near the entrance: a bottle of water and what appears to be a box of cereal or snack food.\n\nThe floor is partially tiled with white tiles, creating a contrast with the darker tones of the cabinets and refrigerator. A roll of paper towels is positioned next to the sink, likely for quick cleanup after meals.
