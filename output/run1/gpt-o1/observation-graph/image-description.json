                "content": "A black‐fronted L‐shaped kitchen occupies one corner. Its marble‐patterned countertop runs beneath matching overhead cabinets and around a corner toward a white refrigerator set against the wall to the right. A sink sits below a wooden‐trimmed window; beside the sink is a small stovetop with a metal pot resting on it. Above the stove hangs a wooden‐edged range hood. On the countertop near the stove lie an orange mug and a brightly colored box labeled “Chucky.” Next to those are a jar of jam and two cereal boxes (“Rice Bubbles” and another “Chucky” box). A short stack of white plates stands alongside two more items: a strawberry Jell‐O box and a cylindrical container of salt.\n\nOn the left end of the same countertop (closer to one tall black pantry cabinet), another jar of jam and the Jell‐O box are visible in front of the salt container, forming a small cluster of pantry goods at the corner.\n\nThe refrigerator stands just to the right of the cabinetry. Beyond it, in the adjacent dining area, a rectangular wooden table occupies the center of the room, surrounded by four white‐upholstered chairs. At the center of the table sits a white fruit bowl holding several oranges; tucked among or behind them is a large labeled water bottle. Near that bowl is a box of shortbread cookies and, farther along the tabletop, a clear pitcher and an empty wine glass. A doorway in the dining area wall is positioned behind one of the chairs, and a single overhead light fixture hangs above the center of the table. The floor throughout is a patterned wood parquet.",
