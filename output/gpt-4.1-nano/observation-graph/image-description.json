On the countertop, there are various food items and containers, including a box of Jello, a box of rice bubbles, a red-lidded container with a label, an orange container, a water bottle, a small red box, a wine glass, and a white pitcher. \n\nTo the left of the countertop, there is a white fridge standing against the wall, positioned near the corner of the room. The fridge is tall and plain with a handle on the right side. \n\nIn the background, there is a doorway leading to another room, which has a wooden door with a handle. The overall environment has white textured walls and a wooden parquet floor. The ceiling has a simple round light fixture. \n\nThe environment also includes a wall-mounted wooden shelf with a speaker or vent underneath it. There are several angles of the room showing the same setup: the kitchen counter with food items, the fridge, and the doorway, all in the same relative positions.",
