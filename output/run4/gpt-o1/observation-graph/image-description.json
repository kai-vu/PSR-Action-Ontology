                "content": "A black‐finished L‐shaped kitchen occupies one corner, with a beige marble countertop running beneath black upper and lower cabinets. At the inner corner of the counter sits a small stainless‐steel sink under a wood‐framed window, and to its right is a stovetop with a small pot resting on it. A wooden range hood hangs overhead. On the countertop beside the stove are a box labeled “Chucky” with a cartoon face, another cereal box labeled “Rice Bubbles,” a jar of jam with a red checkered lid, an orange mug, and a short stack of white plates. Nearer the refrigerator, the same countertop displays another jar of jam, a box of strawberry Jell‑O, a container labeled “Alpen Salt,” and additional stacked plates.\n\nA tall white refrigerator stands at the boundary between the kitchen cabinets and the adjoining dining area. In that dining area, a rectangular wooden table is surrounded by white upholstered chairs. Centered on the table is a white open‐top container holding a large water bottle and several round fruits—visible oranges and at least one other citrus piece. A separate cardboard box sits to the left of the fruit container, and to the right are a clear pitcher with water and an empty wine glass. A single door is located behind one side of the table, and overhead is a round ceiling light fixture. The floor throughout is a parquet wood, and the walls are plain white.",
