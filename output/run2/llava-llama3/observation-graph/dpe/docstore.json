On the far end of the kitchen, a dining table with a single chair can be seen, with a bottle and another box on top of it. A book is lying flat in front of this table. In the corner of the kitchen, there's an open cabinet with more items, including cups and bowls.\n\nThe adjacent dining area features a white countertop along one wall and cabinets above it. The flooring is a light beige color, and a light fixture hangs from the ceiling above the table.
