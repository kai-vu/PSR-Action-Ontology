In the kitchen, there's a black countertop with an open cabinet above it revealing shelves holding various items including canned goods and what appears to be a box of cereal. A sink is installed under this countertop, and next to it are two ovens and a fridge with a white label on its door. There's also a box labeled \"ECO\" near the fridge. On the far end of the kitchen, a dining table with a single chair can be seen, with a bottle and another box on top of it. A book is lying flat in front of this table. In the corner of the kitchen, there's an open cabinet with more items, including cups and bowls.\n\nThe adjacent dining area features a white countertop along one wall and cabinets above it. The flooring is a light beige color, and a light fixture hangs from the ceiling above the table. There are no people or robots visible in this space. ",
