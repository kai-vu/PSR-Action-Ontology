                "content": "A black L-shaped kitchen counter occupies one corner of the room, with black cabinets mounted above and below the beige, marble-patterned countertop. In the corner to the right of these cabinets stands a tall, white refrigerator. Along the countertop near the fridge are several items arranged side by side: a stack of white plates, a jar of jam, a box of strawberry-flavored Jell-O, a cylindrical container of salt labeled “Alpen Salt,” a box labeled “Rice Bubbles,” and another red cereal box labeled “Chucky.” A jar of jam marked “Strawberry Preserve” and an orange mug are positioned closer to the stove area. A small silver pot sits on the stove’s black cooking surface, beneath a wooden range hood suspended from the ceiling. A rectangular window with a wooden frame is set in the wall above the sink, which is embedded in the countertop to the left of the stove.\n\nPast the kitchen area and to the right of the fridge, the space opens into the dining area. A rectangular wooden dining table sits near the center, flanked on each side by cushioned white chairs. On the table, a large transparent pitcher and a single wine glass rest to one side. In front of them, a tall plastic bottle of water labeled “Evian” sits upright in a metal or plastic holder, and a white fruit bowl containing oranges and a lemon is directly behind it. A small black box of shortbread cookies (or a similar packaged item) lies on the table surface near the water. A closed white door is positioned on the wall nearby, behind one of the dining chairs. The floor throughout is a dark wooden parquet.",
